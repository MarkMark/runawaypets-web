            RUNAWAY PETS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT,
            INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR
            DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND

            WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.
          </p>

          <h5>INDEMNIFICATION</h5>

          <p>
            You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or
            activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Runaway Pets request),
            indemnify and hold the Runaway Pets Parties harmless from and
            against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses,
            including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,
            arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following
            (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or
            those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to
            or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these
            Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right,
            including without limitation, any intellectual property right,
            publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your
            violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes,
            ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental
            authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory,
            administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any
            misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required
            by Runaway Pets in the defense of any claim. Runaway Pets reserves
            the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
            subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event
            settle any claim without the prior written consent of Runaway Pets.
          </p>

          <h5>ARBITRATION</h5>

          <p>
            You agree that any and all disputes between you and Runaway Pets
            (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to
            your relationship with Runaway Pets, including without limitation
            disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of Runaway Pets,
            and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by
            binding, individual arbitration under the Australian Arbitration
            Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and
            you and Runaway Pets hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an
            alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"
            court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may
            bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Runaway Pets
            will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any
            claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate
            in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative
            capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account,
            if Runaway Pets is a party to the proceeding. This dispute
            resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration
            Act. In the event the Australian Arbitration Association is
            unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and
            sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Runaway Pets or you
            can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the
            Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award
            rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
            competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law
            notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award
            damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.
          </p>

          <h5>TIME LIMITATION ON CLAIMS</h5>

          <p>
            You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to
            your relationship with Runaway Pets must be filed within twelve
            months after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently
            barred.
          </p>

          <h5>GOVERNING LAW &amp; VENUE</h5>

          <p>
            These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with
            the laws of the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth of
            Australia. For any action at law or in equity relating to the
            arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes
            or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to
            resolve any dispute you have with Runaway Pets exclusively in the
            courts of the State of New South Wales, Australia. If any provision
            of these Terms of Use, including those found in the Arbitration
            Provision, is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason
            unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent
            jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from and
            will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
            provisions. Runaway Pets failure to insist upon or enforce strict
            performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as
            a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms
            will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
            condition or any other term or condition. Runaway Pets reserves the
            right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such
            changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date
            of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the
            termination of any or all of your transactions with Runaway Pets.
          </p>

          <h5>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h5>

          <p>
            If you are using Runaway Pets on behalf of a legal entity, you
            represent that you are authorised to enter into an agreement on
            behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the
            entire agreement between you and Runaway Pets and governs your use
            of Runaway Pets, superseding any prior agreements between you and
            Runaway Pets. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any
            rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part,
            whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior
            written consent of Runaway Pets. Any purported assignment or
            delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of
            Runaway Pets will be null and void. Runaway Pets may assign these
            Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any
            provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent
            jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties
            nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from
            these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and
            enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining
            provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.
            Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice
            will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not
            confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
          </p>

          <p>
            The information provided within Runaway Pets is not intended for
            distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction
            or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law
            or regulation or which would subject Runaway Pets to any
            registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We
            reserve the right to limit the availability of Runaway Pets or any
            portion of Runaway Pets, to any person, geographic area, or
